Personal website *in progress*

## My journey so far
I am Alper, a driven PhD student with a unique blend of expertise in molecular biology, genetics, and data science. I completed my BSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics at Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey, before moving to the Netherlands to pursue my MSc in Molecular Mechanisms of Disease at Radboud University in Nijmegen. Throughout my studies, I had the opportunity to work in research laboratories at various prestigious institutions, including Bogazici University, KU Leuven, Radboud University, and the University of Oxford, under the guidance of outstanding supervisors in stimulating research environments.

Currently, I am a PhD student at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. My research focuses on utilizing data-driven approaches to gain insights into the aging immune system and identifying individuals at risk of immune dysfunction. With a strong background in both immunology and data science, I am dedicated to advancing our understanding of the aging immune system and improving health outcomes for individuals at risk of immune dysfunction.
